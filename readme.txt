For this assignment, I based it off of Shiffman's algorithm. I added a terrain
to make the project look less plain, but I made it after I had made my path so
things are not scaled properly.

The followers are constantly seeking the next point, and will continue to
even if they have to avoid other followers.

I set the camera overhead so there is a view of the entire path and all the 
followers.
